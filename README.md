## Project Overview
This project constructs a composite economic risk index for Albania from 2010 to 2023, combining FX 

volatility, inflation changes, energy price shocks, and tourism trends. The index visualizes how 

these factors contributed to economic risk over time, highlighting key events such as the COVID-19 

pandemic.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combines foreign exchange rates, inflation (CPI), energy prices (oil), and tourism data into a unified dataset.
- **Risk Factor Engineering**: Computes returns, rolling volatility, and standardized (z-score) risk factors for each economic indicator.
- **Composite Risk Index**: Constructs an aggregate Albania Economic Risk Index by averaging normalized risk factors across sectors.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracks economic risk trends from 2010 to 2023, enabling comparison across normal periods and crisis events (e.g., COVID-19).
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handles inconsistent formats, missing values, and mixed-frequency data using pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Generates clear time-series plots to illustrate shifts in economic risk over time.
