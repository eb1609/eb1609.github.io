## Project Overview
This project constructs a composite economic risk index for Albania from 2010 to 2023, combining FX 

volatility, inflation changes, energy price shocks, and tourism trends. The index visualizes how 

these factors contributed to economic risk over time, highlighting key events such as the COVID-19 

pandemic.
